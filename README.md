# Warwick POIs

I saw funny columns on the OpenStreetMap with strange names, and realized that they
are all over the Warwick Campus.
As it's RSECon25, I thought that's a fun project to make a "Go catch 'em all"
game, where people can write messages while being at the POIs.
Of course it took way longer than the 1 hour I was hoping to get up and started.

- 2h for initial hacking
- 3h for CI/CD
- 3h for server storage
- 2h to do some cleanup
